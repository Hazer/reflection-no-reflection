A proof on concept to create an API that is 100% compatible reflection API, but without any reflection. Performance stuff for Android and Java. 

We hope to create a new technology that can improve all reflection based libraries for Android and Java.

The main idea is to create a reflection compatible API using annotation processing and byte code weaving.

This project has been initiated by the Android Groupon team, 2014.
